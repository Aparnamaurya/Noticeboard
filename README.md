Blockchains can be thought as a data structure that contains a sequence of data entries. More generally, the entries are first placed into blocks in a sequential order, and then the blocks are added to a “chain” of similar blocks.

The Ethereum platform is an decnetralized platorm which is used to create the SmartContracts, which are nothing but programmes which once run just the way they are designed.
